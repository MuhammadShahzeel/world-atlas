- **Browsing**: View a list of all countries.
- **Search & Filter**: Find countries by name or region.
- **Country Details**: Access in-depth information on each country.
- **Custom Error Page**: Handles invalid routes gracefully.

Built with **React Router DOM** for navigation and **Axios** for fetching data from an API, itâ€™s an excellent project to practice React essentials like routing, data fetching, state management.
